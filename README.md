## Overture
Hello, passionate reader!

If you have a curious mind and want to befriend a computer, this has the right audience!

Here, I will teach you about all the aspects of using computers and programming. This will be something like a survival kit for a programmer, and by the end of this project, you should be able to have conversations with other developers, read and write code, and be able to comfortably use programming for automation of everyday tasks, your research projects, and your creations of software and games.

In "Befriending Computers," I will focus on writing high-quality material, and together with the basic programming syntax and theory, I will incorporate all needed tools, practices, and secondary materials that are often forgotten about and not mentioned in other places.

The plan is that I will publish 1 chapter (sometimes I'll refer to them as "logs") every Friday morning and send a link to you through email, so you can enjoy it throughout the last day of the week or weekends, depending on when you'll have time and mood. I highly suggest reading it on or with a computer and following the instructions here.

I will be publishing these articles on [GitHub](https://github.com/umartokyo/Befriending-Computer) and [Medium](https://umarbektokyo.medium.com/list/befriending-computer-5d5de2d10334), where you can enjoy these writings and stay tuned via my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/umarbektokyo/) or [Medium Newsletters](https://umarbektokyo.medium.com/subscribe).

A younger sister of mine (an 11-year-old artist) and a few other people are in beta testing for Befriending Computer to make sure that the content's quality is high and it's understandable for everyone. If you'd like to join the beta program, then please message me through Instagram or mail.

Feel free to share this project with your friends who might be interested!
