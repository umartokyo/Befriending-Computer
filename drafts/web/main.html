        <h1>How to befriend a computer</h1>
        <p>By the plan this is a series through which you can learn about coding, so if you came here with this in mind you're in a right place! I won't tell the story of my life to you right now, but shortly, I've been learning how to code for past several years, and it was a quite tough journey for me. The problem was in an overdoze with theory and lack of intuition. If the first problem is relatively easy to solve, second one is a thing which hides underneath searface, and which many people don't even think about. Shortly, intuition is "the ability to understand something instinctively". I would also call it a spider-sense. There are many great cources, tutorials, books which would teach you a lot, and I've gone through many of them, but yet I couldn't find any place where you would learn the "profession of coding", starting from planning, coding, organization, code maintainance & style, deployement... So I decided to help out to people who want to learn about and maybe one day become programmers, and don't worry, I'll spice up this journey with various quizzes, other sources, tips & tricks & more. This website will be updating with new resources every Friday morning, and if you don't want to miss out, subscribe to the newsletter and/or follow me on instagram. With these words said, let's begin?</p>
