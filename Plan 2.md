  - [ ] Why is this
- [ ] Intro (Intro is one chapter)
  - [ ] What do programmers do +[map of programming]
  Why would we learn that
  - [ ] How does computer read our code (one by line from top to bottom)
  - [ ] Operational systems and terminals (don’t be scared, this is just a file system. Show basic commands like “ls”, “cd”, “mkdir”, “nano”
  - [ ] Programming Languages +[Python] +[Download Python]+[What are IDE’s]+[Download Visual Studio Code]
- [ ] Python Basics
  - [ ] Commands & Operations (stuff like print(), input(), +-…)
  - [ ] Variables and data types (None, Bool, Char, Strings, Integers, Floats) (Talking about mutable immutable, true, false, global, local…)
  - [ ] Conditional Code +[adventure game Project]+[unprint]
  - [ ] Functions +[currency/temperature converter Project]
  - [ ] White loops +[number Guesser] and For loops +[Prime Number Algorithm]+[what is algorithm]
  - [ ] Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries +[Grade Calculator]+Life-hack which one is better.
- [ ] Intermediate Python
  - [ ] Packages and Virtual Environments +[dad jokes]
  - [ ] Modules and Working with other files +[if name == ‘main’]
  - [ ] OOP +[virtual pet]
  - [ ] Errors and Exceptions, Testing types and Unit-Tests
  - [ ] Comprehensions and lambda functions
  - [ ] Git and Github + Polaroid Image Effect project (cv2)
  - [ ] Databases, SQLite
  - [ ] GUI’s with tkinter + to-do list
- [ ] Final [after I finished posting everything, the last post will be about…]
  - [ ] Take a look at Google’s Writing Guide
  - [ ] Learn Flask/Django/Fast if you want to work on web
  - [ ] Learn Docker
  - [ ] Learn basics of Web
  - [ ] Learn more about algorithms if you want to work
  - [ ] There’s such thing called paired programming
  - [ ] Open source your code
  - [ ] How to practice coding: leetcode, projects…
  - [ ] You can also try paired programming
  - [ ] Goor Resources to learn more 
  - [ ] I will still post some projects, and hope to see ya soon ;)
